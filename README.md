# telescope-tool

This rep contains the source code for the [telescope web application](https://share.streamlit.io/fakahil/telescope-tool/app.py) that I have written using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

With this app you can enter the optical parameters of any telescope+camera combination in the left hand menu and derive important output for the imaged scene with your optical setup like the FOV, spatial resolution, exit pupil size, etc.

There is also an option to simulate the corresponding optical aberrations of the output wavefront by choosing the number of Zernike polynomials and the corresponding values (in units of wavelength). The application can visualize the wavefront error, the 2D and 1D Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the telescope.
